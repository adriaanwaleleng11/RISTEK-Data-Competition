# RISTEK-Data-Competition
I participated in the Ristek UI Competition in November 2023 with two friends. The challenge was to do a regression to predict ride-hailing service price based on factors related to timing, weather, distance, and price surge. 
Performed feature engineering and tried multiple machine learning models such as CatBoost, XGboost, and LightGBM.
Managed to finish in the tope 10 out of 34 teams
